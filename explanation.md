<p>The point of  *POET*  is to advocate a user centered design,a  philosophy based on the needs and interests of the user,with an emphasis on making products usable and understandable.
</p>
In this chapter the following will be discussed:1.summary of the main principles,
                                                   2.discussion of the implications,
                                                   3.offering of suggestions.

####*Design should:*
                    i.Make it easy to determine actions to be followed.
                    ii.make things visible.
                    iii.make it easy for evaluation.
                    
#######*The design should make sure  that the user is able to configure what is happening and make sure that the design crosses in a valid meaning to the user.*

Here are :
#####seven principles for transforming difficult tasks into simple ones
                        *i.use of knowledge in the world and the head.*
                        *ii.simplify the structure of tasks.*
                        *iii.make things visible.*
                        *iv.Get mappings right.*
                        *v.exploit natural and artificial power of constraints.*
                        *vi.Design for error*
                        *viii.when all else fail,starndadize*

#######*Evaluating the seven principles:*
---
#####<mark>i.USE OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE WORLD AND THE HEAD.</mark>
---
Tasks require you to implement knowledge you have to execute them.In implementing tasks you can either acqiure knowledge internally or externally.Internally is where you acqiure knowledge officially but externally is where you acqiure knowledge unofficially.

####THREE CONCEPTUAL MODELS: 
             i.Design model
             ii.User model
             iii.System image
<h4>ROLE OF MANUALS.<h4>
<em>Manuals are useful in the sense that they help the customers know how to operate a certain task in the design model.But manuals dont usually have every detail on the design model being  used.</em>
#####<mark>ii.SIMPIFY THE STRUCTURE OF TASKS.</mark>
The tasks can be simplified using technological innovations.
Tasks can be fast to get.But some tasks depend on the piece of information in the tasks.
The fast to get are stored in Long term memory elsewise hard to get are  stored in short term memory.
Long tasks in order to be stored in long term memory need technological innovations.
<h2>Four major technological innovattions can be followed:</h2>
<h3>1.Keep the task much the same but provide mental aids</h3>
i.Here some tasks  have much information which the brain cannot contain,so some items such as notebooks,computers are used to store information.
<h3>2.Use technology to make visible what is invisible thus improving feedback  and ability to keep control</h3>
i.Some tasks have hidden information that needs more clarification for one to understand.Such as the computers.They provide easier notes which bring out a clearer meaning.
<h3>3.Automate but keep the task much the same</h3>
i.Here the topic explains that the long tasks sometimes need to be shortened so that the task completion can be easy so the task is reduced  to a small amount of task.some people remove some parts of the tasks changing the meaning of the tasks.
<h3>4.Change the nature of the task</h3>
i.Some tasks that exist today in their normal forms are results of the evolution of the tasks whereby the tasks have been made easier to deal with.eg.i.shoe lace evolved into a hold and loop.
                       ii.a digital clock which evolved from a bell and altimeters.
<h3>5.DONT TAKE AWAY CONTROL</h3>
i.Automation is good but overautomation may cause one to lose proffessional reliance of the task.eg:a plane breaking down so the pilot loses control of the plane hence accepting end result.means he/she is a servant tto the task.
#####MAKE THINGS VISIBLE:BRIDGE THE GULFS OF EXECUTION AND EVALUATION
The system image plays a key role in the customer realization of how a certain system works.eg.the cd player and the remote with a mettallic aerial like rod.
#####GET THE MAPPINGS RIGHT
Exploit natural mappings:The user should determine the relationships between the:
          i.Intentions and possible actions.
          ii.Actions and their effects on the system.
          iii.Actual system state and what is perceivable by sight sound or feel.
          iv.perceved system state and the needs intentions and expectations of the user.
#####EXPLOIT THE POWER OF CONSTRAINTS,BOTH NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL.
