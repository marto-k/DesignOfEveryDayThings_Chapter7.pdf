<p>The point of  *POET*  is to advocate a user centered design,a  philosophy based on the needs and interests of the user,with an emphasis on making products usable and understandable.
</p>
In this chapter the following will be discussed:1.summary of the main principles,
                                                   2.discussion of the implications,
                                                   3.offering of suggestions.

####*Design should:*
                    i.Make it easy to determine actions to be followed.
                    ii.make things visible.
                    iii.make it easy for evaluation.
                    
#######*The design should make sure  that the user is able to configure what is happening and make sure that the design crosses in a valid meaning to the user.*

Here are :
#####seven principles for transforming difficult tasks into simple ones
                        *i.use of knowledge in the world and the head.*
                        *ii.simplify the structure of tasks.*
                        *iii.make things visible.*
                        *iv.Get mappings right.*
                        *v.exploit natural and artificial power of constraints.*
                        *vi.Design for error*
                        *viii.when all else fail,starndadize*

#######*Evaluating the seven principles:*
---
#####i.USE OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE WORLD AND THE HEAD.
---
Tasks require you to implement knowledge you have to execute them.In implementing tasks you can either acqiure knowledge internally or externally.Internally is where you acqiure knowledge officially but externally is where you acqiure knowledge unofficially.

####THREE CONCEPTUAL MODELS: 
             i.Design model
             ii.User model
             iii.System image
<h4>ROLE OF MANUALS.<h4>
<em>Manuals are useful in the sense that they help the customers know how to operate a certain task in the design model.But manuals dont usually have every detail on the design model being  used.</em>
<h5>ii.SIMPIFY THE STRUCTURE OF TASKS.</h5>
The tasks can be simplified using technological innovations.
Tasks can be fast to get.But some tasks depend on the piece of information in the tasks.
The fast to get are stored in Long term memory elsewise hard to get are  stored in short term memory.
Long tasks in order to be stored in long term memory need technological innovations.
<h2>Four major technological innovattions can be followed:</h2>
<h3>1.Keep the task much the same but provide mental aids</h3>
i.Here some tasks  have much information which the brain cannot contain,so some items such as notebooks,computers are used to store information.
<h3>2.Use technology to make visible what is invisible thus improving feedback  and ability to keep control</h3>
i.Some tasks have hidden information that needs more clarification for one to understand.Such as the computers.They provide easier notes which bring out a clearer meaning.
<h3>3.Automate but keep the task much the same</h3>
i.Here the topic explains that the long tasks sometimes need to be shortened so that the task completion can be easy so the task is reduced  to a small amount of task.some people remove some parts of the tasks changing the meaning of the tasks.
<h3>4.Change the nature of the task</h3>
i.Some tasks that exist today in their normal forms are results of the evolution of the tasks whereby the tasks have been made easier to deal with.eg.i.shoe lace evolved into a hold and loop.
                       ii.a digital clock which evolved from a bell and altimeters.
<h3>5.DONT TAKE AWAY CONTROL</h3>
i.Automation is good but overautomation may cause one to lose proffessional reliance of the task.eg:a plane breaking down so the pilot loses control of the plane hence accepting end result.means he/she is a servant tto the task.
<h5>iii.MAKE THINGS VISIBLE:BRIDGE THE GULFS OF EXECUTION AND EVALUATION</h5>
The system image plays a key role in the customer realization of how a certain system works.eg.the cd player and the remote with a mettallic aerial like rod.
<h5>iv.GET THE MAPPINGS RIGHT</h5>
Exploit natural mappings:The user should determine the relationships between the:
          i.Intentions and possible actions.
          ii.Actions and their effects on the system.
          iii.Actual system state and what is perceivable by sight sound or feel.
          iv.perceved system state and the needs intentions and expectations of the user.
<h5>v.EXPLOIT THE POWER OF CONSTRAINTS,BOTH NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL.</h5>
Constaraints  are used to make the user feel there is only one possible action to be done.
<h6>DESIGN FOR ERROR</h6> 
This is shows the user the error and tries to make the user think that their option is considered but gives them a  solution of the ans.

<h6>WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,STANDARDIZE</h6>
Standardaizing is a good  hence problem solving situation where it brings  one understanding to the user

<h6>STANDARDIZATION AND TECNOLOGY</h6>
This happens where the designer chooses the type of standardization due to tecnological effects

<h6>THE TIMING OF STNDARDIZATION</h6>
This is where the newness of the design model matters.The best time to do this is much later after the launch of the model design to ensure no mistakes come forth

<h5>Deliberately making things difficult</h5>
This is necessary when you are precautioning over issues such as handicap,children safety etc.example for this a door whose open handle is on top of door and a push handle  at center.

<h5>DESIGNING A DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS GAME</h5>
This is a game where requires one to figure out a solution to thrive hence making experinced gamers more intimate about playing the game

<h4>EASY LOOKING IS  NOT NECESSARILLY EASY TO USE</h4>
These are model used to do something.eg.game pad.may look easy to use but the design function is what matters.

<b>Design and society</b>
The society is rapidly changing whereby new fashions have emerged hence knocking off old designs.This is a major influence to user on the model usage.

<h4>HOW WRITING METHOD AFFECTS STYLE</h4>
The style has been tampered whreby technological innovations such as computers have changed how people edit texts and formats used for writing.

<h6>FROM QUIL AND INK TO KEYBORD AND MICROPHONE</h6>
This has made it better for users to write and read texts from technology than on paper,which is an example of design and society  change

<h6>OUTLINE PROCESSORS AND HYPERTEXT</h6>
The outline processors are ones which help in arranging the work of the texts likewise to headings.This also  affects the format used for the text.
The hypertext is the one that highlights the texts or shows texts in form of underlining.

<h3>THE HOME OF THE FUTURE:A PLACE OF COMFORT OR A NEW SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION</h3>
As the design models change the smart house is one that is wished to come whereby automobilization will occur where you will have to do everything without physically working on it.
This is said in the future will have differences where users will not have adequate knowledge to know how the design model which will be a major problem and on the other hand the user will have an easy time working on his /her things.the both conditions will have contrasts.


<h5>The Design of Everyday Things</h5> 
The designers and users view design in different perspectives whereby users dont have full knowledge of design models today where as the designers know all about them.
